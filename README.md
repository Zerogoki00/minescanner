##Introduction

Minescanner is an open-source tool for searching for Minecraft servers in IP ranges.

It parses [masscan](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan) report file and attempts to connect to each server and extract data (MOTD, player count, etc).

##Installation
Install [masscan](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan)

Create venv:
```
python3 -m venv .venv
```
Activate venv:
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```
Install requirements:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Alternatively you can install them system-wide.

##Usage
First you need to scan IP ranges:
```
 sudo masscan -e <device> -p25565 --rate <rate> -iL in/<ranges list> -oL scanned/<filename>
```
You can find more information about masscan's usage on its [GitHub page](ttps://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan).

After scanning you can start minescanner using this command:
```
python3 minescanner2 scanned/<filename> out/<filename> -n <num of processes>
```
The default number of processes is 4, but I recommend setting 20-40 because it will save a lot of time.

Minescanner will start scanning and will write results in CSV format.
